Project to design and implement my own version of a databse utilizing a Java HashMap. Example dataset used is that of Faculty and Student objects which can be read/written from a CSV file and created/removed using the terminal application. 

Can be tested by either creating a new file or loading in from provided *text.txt* example file

Worked with Mary Shkouratoff from Chapman Univ. for portion of project. Specifically she contributed to read/write of files feature.

Navigate to folder containing the files in this repository and run the following command:

> javac AffiliateDriver.java Affiliate.java Faculty.java AssistantProfessor.java AssociateProfessor.java FullProfessor.java Student.java Graduate.java Undergraduate.java Staff.java PartTime.java FullTime.java

and then...

> java AffiliateDriver
